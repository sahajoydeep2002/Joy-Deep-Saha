      About Me:
    </em>
  </h3>
  <p>Hello! I'm Joy Deep Saha, a Computer Science Freshman at BITS Pilani, driven by a passion for developing innovative solutions and a keen interest in financial markets. As an aspiring developer, I've immersed myself in numerous hackathons, webinars, and workshops, collaborating with talented developers worldwide. My dedication to problem-solving and creativity has led me to create projects that make a positive impact on people's daily lives.</p>
  <p>Hailing from Agartala, a small town in Northeast India, I've faced my share of challenges. Despite limited resources and personal hardships, I've remained steadfast in my commitment to education and innovation. My determination and hard work have placed me among the top 1% of students in my school, and I continue to excel academically at BITS Pilani.</p>
  <p>Outside of academics, I'm an active member of the Google Student Developer Community, where I participate in workshops and collaborative projects. I regularly attend tech meetups, conferences, and podcasts to expand my professional network and stay updated on industry trends. My involvement in open-source projects and coding competitions as a competitive programmer showcases my dedication to the tech community.</p>
  <p>In addition to my passion for technology, I'm a skilled writer who enjoys crafting short stories, articles, and poems. I find solace in the creative process, often drawing inspiration from quiet moments spent with a cup of tea under a starry night sky. As an active member of the Local Writers Association, I'm able to share my love for writing with others.</p>
  <p>When I'm not immersed in technology or writing, I enjoy reading books, jogging, streaming movies and web series, and volunteering in my community. These hobbies allow me to maintain a healthy work-life balance and stay connected with the world around me.</p>
  <p>As a 21-year-old college student from a close-knit family, I'm driven by the sacrifices my parents made and their unwavering belief in my potential. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've been given and am committed to making a positive impact in the lives of others through my work in Computer Science and Machine Learning.</p>
  <p>For me ML is interesting, we are giving the computer the goal state "I want this outcome," and then the computer itself is learning how to do it. That's where Machine Learning comes from, according to me.</p>
  <p>I invite you to connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more about my journey, projects, and aspirations. Let's collaborate and create a brighter future together!</p>
